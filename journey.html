											<h3>The year is 2006.</h3>
										</header>
										<p>There is a 12 year old boy sitting in a classroom in St. Paul’s School, India. It is recess time, and all of his friends are outside playing in the playground. The boy watches, wishing he could be outside with them.</p>
										<p>He takes a deep breath and moves his head down. Even such a simple movement as this is a challenge for him.</p>
										<p>The boy’s name is Anshuman Dubey. In 2002 at the age of 8, Anshuman was diagnosed with a neuromuscular disorder known as Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy, or CIDP. CIDP is a rare disorder of the peripheral nerves characterized by gradually increasing weakness of a person’s legs and arms. Although this disease is very severe, Anshuman did not cry about it and instead used his unique experiences to try to inspire others. In that classroom in 2006, Anshuman wrote his first poem, “Veer Parichay.”
										<p>3 years later in 2009, Anshuman finished his book, Chhoti Si Umar, a collection of 30 poems in Hindi and English. The book was published in India and received very well by many people, including Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, a former president of India. Following the success of Chhoti Si Umar, there was an overwhelming demand for it to be translated and published in English. Unfortunately, Anshuman passed away in 2011 and was not able to experience this.</p>
										<p>The year is 2015. Two high school boys in Virginia, USA, read Chhoti Si Umar and are inspired to spread Anshuman’s message to more people. The project “Tender Years” is created.</p>
