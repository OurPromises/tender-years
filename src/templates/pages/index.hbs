            <h2>A profound <strong>book</strong> of poems
            <br />
            written by late master Anshuman Dubey</h2>
            <p>Anshuman Dubey passed away at the age of sixteen from a neuromuscular disorder known as CIDP, or Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy. CIDP affects the peripheral nerves of the body and causes gradual weakness and loss of senses and reflexes. Although CIDP is treatable, it is very difficult and expensive to get a treatment in the rural area where Anshuman lived. However, even though Anshuman was incapacitated for a long time, he was able to express his thoughts and feelings through this book of poems. He wrote the book to inspire us to be courageous and overcome the many challenges of life.

                    <p>Life is the only time;
That you have to spend on Earth.
So commence your action now;
And make it worth.
Life is not always there;
It is not the question of life and death-
Because that rests in His hands;
But take a vow today, that in each moment of life-
You will feel cheer and gay!</p>

                    <p>Under the shade of trees;
In the backyard
Playing with ease,
Those moments of mother’s love
And father’s affectionate hug,
How I would run carelessly
At one call of friends for fun.
When the curiosity arises;
The childhood unfolds yet a new leaf.</p>

That, all difficulties shy away-
Let the confidence be your companion;
So that, any trouble what may come,
Is left, with no option.
Let your determination ripe;
And courage and strength join.
Fearlessly tread ahead-
And climb each rung of success,
With patient, grit instead.</p>
