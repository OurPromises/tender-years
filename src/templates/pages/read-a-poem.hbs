<h3>Excerpt from Slight Age by Anshuman Dubey</h3>


When the path was not difficult;

There was no concern with the world

The mind was tensionless

How precious childhood was!

 how innocent, were those moments;

And how lovely was that life-

That sky of dreams

And land of imagination-

Those moments were experienced,

Playing, the naughty tricks.

Enjoying the colorful scene,

Playing in the rain!

And swaying in the breeze

This lonely, heart laments someone-

sometime to freeze that childhood.

										<p>Under the shade of trees;<br>
											In the backyard<br>
											Playing with ease,<br>
											Those moments of mother’s love<br>
											And father’s affectionate hug,<br>
											How I would run carelessly<br>
											At one call of friends for fun.<br>
											When the curiosity arises;<br>
											The childhood unfolds yet a new leaf.<br>
